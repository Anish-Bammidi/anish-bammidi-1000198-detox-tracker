## Project Overview

Excessive social-media use (2–3 hrs/day) is linked to anxiety, disrupted sleep, and reduced productivity. The **Social Media Detox Tracker** helps users monitor, limit, and reduce their screen time through gentle nudges, gamified rewards, and simple goal-setting, all in a non-judgmental way.

## Design Thinking Process

1. **Empathize & Define**  
   - Conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 10) and surveys (n = 60)  
   - Created empathy maps and affinity clusters  
   - Developed three personas (Alex, Priya, Raj)  
   - Articulated the problem statement:  
     > *How might we empower users to manage screen time through non-judgmental monitoring, gamified rewards, and subtle motivational nudges?*

2. **Ideate**  
   - Brainstormed 40+ feature ideas in a Miro workshop  
   - Selected top concepts via an Impact–Effort Matrix  

3. **Prototype**  
   - Low-fidelity wireframes in Figma → high-fidelity mockups in Adobe XD  
   - Core screens: Signup/Login, Dashboard, Goal-Setter, Rewards, Notifications  

4. **Test**  
   - Usability sessions (n = 5) measuring success rate, time-on-task, error rate, and SUS score  
   - Iterated UI language and interaction flows; planned A/B tests on nudge messaging
