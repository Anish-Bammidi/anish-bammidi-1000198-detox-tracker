## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Personas & Empathy Mapping  
Created two key personas and an empathy map to capture behaviors and needs :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:

| Persona | Age | Role       | Goals                                 | Pain Points                       |
|---------|-----|------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Meera | 19  | Student    | Improve focus during study sessions   | Distracted by notifications       |
| SAI  | 28  | Developer  | Curb late-night scrolling            | Feels gratification seeking       |

Use empathy-mapping (Thinks, Says, Does, Feels) to uncover emotional triggers and app desires :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
